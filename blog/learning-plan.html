        <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Long Term Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I would love to be able to work on projects with my brothers who are both employed in the field of software.</li>
          <li>Long term I want the flexibility to be able to do contract work with companies back in NZ while my wife and I live in various places around the world.</li>
          <li>I would like to create simple apps that allow for me to streamline things in my life.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Strengths:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I have a good understanding of logic based concepts. My math background helps a lot here for breaking down problems into steps and solving piece by piece.</li>
          <li>I have the capacity to settle in and focus for a solid few hours before needing a short break to refresh and maintain productivity.</li>
          <li>I have a good support network between my wife and family we live with that excited to see me succeed.</li>
          <li>I enjoy working with others and am excited by the way DevAcademy and software in general can do it via distance.</li>
          <li>I'm very curious and keen to learn new concepts and ways to improve how my code can function or be utilised.</li>
          <li>I'm persistent. Even if it means putting a problem down and coming back to it later with fresh learning to apply.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I can be a perfectionist. While this is sometimes helpful in my drive to do things well, learn new concepts and apply them to my code. It also can mean I spend too much time on something thats fine and I could move on from.</li>
          <li>I am very hard on myself, I think it comes from the earlier point of being a perfectionist. Maintaining a positive attitude is occasionally a challenge if I'm stuck on an idea. Reflecting on learning some of the more difficult math concepts I know I can spend days and days on one theory, trying to understand it and get rather mad myself when it wasn't clicking.</li>
          <li>I always put people and their situations before my own. While this is great for being a citizen of the world, this does mean I can sometimes struggle with maintaining my planned schedule when theres a lot going on in the lives of my important people.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Skill Development:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to feel comfortable with the technical challenges of JS and have developed a good approach to learning new languages.</li>
          <li>I want to develop the ability to collaborate well via distance through discord communications and git for projects as this is likely going to be how I engage with software collaboration over my lifetime.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Managing Workload:</h3>
        <p>Based in the Cayman Islands the work week will start my sunday afternoons into the evening, through to thursday evenings.
          <br>I plan to do my run in the morning to then settle in to get any solo work done in the mornings before engaging with the classes in my afternoons.
          <br>This will be a little challenging on Sunday mornings, however I'll have fridays and saturdays to ensure I'm ready for sunday afternoon classes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Seeking Help:</h3>
        <p>I will largely use discord for seeking help.
          <br>My homegroup-six will be the first port of call as we have a few experienced programmers. I expect it will almost always be the last.
          <br>Knowing that my schedule is a little off from those of the rest of the class I'll work ahead where I can so I don't get stuck in the morning and have to wait until the afternoon before I can get past my block.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Expectations from Facilitators:</h3>
        <p>Clear communication via discord with any changes or expectations of me.
          <br>Timely responses to my discord questions when I'm stuck on something and the homegroup isn't responding or isn't sure on the solution.
          <br>Responses are only expected within the regular work hours for NZ.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Scheduling Information:</h3>
        <p>I have little to no other commitments during this course's period.
          <br>I am in a different timezone however. 6-7 hours ahead but behind a day.
          <br>This means I may fade slightly more than others towards the end of the workday but I am adjusting my sleep schedule and planning to take naps around my midday before classes start during bootcamp.
