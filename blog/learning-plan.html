        <h3>Long Term Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          Long term I would like to be able to be able to work from distance as my wife and I live abroad and 
          intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Getting initial experience could be a challenge 
          but once I'm marketable getting distance contracts should be very feasible and allow for a somewhat flexible 
          work schedule. With a few programmers in my family I expect it will be useful for creating projects together, 
          maybe one day one of them will be lucrative, maybe, hopefully.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Strengths and Limitations:</h3>
        <p>
          For the most part I think my strengths will be pretty similar, understanding of logic, enjoying collaboration, 
          good support network, curiosity and persistance.
          <br>
          I think the math background will be increasingly useful for more complicated projects so I'm looking forward to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfectionism will still be my main limitation, I think. I just really like to get things right.
          <br>
          For example I added a little AI to play against for tic-tac-toe. Very simple, I'd play it, that was fun, good learning 
          experience, but then I'd beat it a couple times, I'd realise how/why, and I'd be back to adjusting that function. There 
          was little learning to do after first getting it to work but I just really wanted to improve it and ended up spending hours 
          researching tic-tac-toe to then realise I needed to just move on.
          <br>
          <br>  
          With the expectation of how busy things could be I've been better at telling people no, sorry, cant, busy. Its going to 
          be interesting putting it to the test when some friends come visit for 2.5 weeks. They'll be keen to do things during the 
          day while the rest of the house is at work and since I'm in a different timezone I won't have Bootcamp until the afternoon.
          However, I expect I'll have things I could/should do during those times.
          <br>      
          I think I've vastly improved in being too hard on myself. Its something I've been aware of for 
          a number of years now and I think actively considering it and working on it this last month or so has been noticable.
          That or its just been a great month to be me.

        <h3>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest challenge will be staying mentally positive both while some friends visit for 2.5 weeks who I havn't seen in a 
          couple of years and then, honestly, the last week where I was booked to be at a surf resort in Nicaragua but had to cancel 
          when I got accepted to this course. I know it was the right choice for me doing this course but being busy and having to 
          miss some of these special experiences will suck. Specially when some of the guys start sending back pics and videos.

        <h3>Human Skills I'd Like to Develop</h3>
        <p>
          I need to learn to be ok getting a project done, functioning, minor possible improvements but then move on.
          <br>
          Talking to a brother whos in the programming industry hes mentioned how all projects, all companies, have a known list 
          of bugs in their projects and they just get them to a managable level and then keep pushing development.
          <br>
          To the point where some of the job advertisements actually state that they are looking for someone whos ok with moving 
          on from minor bugs and being more 'efficient' with their time than just bug fixing forever.
          <br>
          That would be useful for me to find a good balance between wanting to do things well, and being ok with ok when the 
          situtation demands it.

        <h3>Expectants of Bootcamp Team:</h3>
        <p>
          I expect a well thought out and functional program. Foundations has been great, but with a more structured schedule I 
          expect things to flow well. If I'm stuck and my initial attempts to problem solve are unsuccessful (e.g. discord group chat, etc.) 
          then someone will be available to nudge me in the right direction. So far DevAcademy has been miles ahead of Massey in terms 
          of quality of education, both in how the information is delivered and how the options exist to stretch in areas that you are 
          comfortable in. I took an education major and honestly, I've been impressed with the way foundations could meet different students 
          where they were, both by elevating those with less understanding and by pushing those with more competency. (Joel and David had a 
          conversation about one of the extra challenges and its so far beyond me that I didn't even understand most of what they were saying. 
          The fact this exists while others are learning to make clickable moles is excellent).

        <h3>Expectations of Me:</h3>
        <p>
          I expect myself to continue following my learning plan and my well-being plan.
          <br>
          I expect myself to manage being blocked efficiently, not to delay too long, reach out to my discord group then the wider community.
          <br>
          I expect myself to do a better job of having discord running in the background so I can see notifications in a timely manner.
          So I can respond to those that I may be able to help before they need to seek out others.

      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Long Term Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I would love to be able to work on projects with my brothers who are both employed in the field of software.</li>
          <li>Long term I want the flexibility to be able to do contract work with companies back in NZ while my wife and I live in various places around the world.</li>
          <li>I would like to create simple apps that allow for me to streamline things in my life.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Strengths:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I have a good understanding of logic based concepts. My math background helps a lot here for breaking down problems into steps and solving piece by piece.</li>
          <li>I have the capacity to settle in and focus for a solid few hours before needing a short break to refresh and maintain productivity.</li>
          <li>I have a good support network between my wife and family we live with that excited to see me succeed.</li>
          <li>I enjoy working with others and am excited by the way DevAcademy and software in general can do it via distance.</li>
          <li>I'm very curious and keen to learn new concepts and ways to improve how my code can function or be utilised.</li>
          <li>I'm persistent. Even if it means putting a problem down and coming back to it later with fresh learning to apply.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I can be a perfectionist. While this is sometimes helpful in my drive to do things well, learn new concepts and apply them to my code. It also can mean I spend too much time on something thats fine and I could move on from.</li>
          <li>I am very hard on myself, I think it comes from the earlier point of being a perfectionist. Maintaining a positive attitude is occasionally a challenge if I'm stuck on an idea. Reflecting on learning some of the more difficult math concepts I know I can spend days and days on one theory, trying to understand it and get rather mad myself when it wasn't clicking.</li>
          <li>I always put people and their situations before my own. While this is great for being a citizen of the world, this does mean I can sometimes struggle with maintaining my planned schedule when theres a lot going on in the lives of my important people.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Skill Development:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to feel comfortable with the technical challenges of JS and have developed a good approach to learning new languages.</li>
          <li>I want to develop the ability to collaborate well via distance through discord communications and git for projects as this is likely going to be how I engage with software collaboration over my lifetime.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Managing Workload:</h3>
        <p>Based in the Cayman Islands the work week will start my sunday afternoons into the evening, through to thursday evenings.
          <br>I plan to do my run in the morning to then settle in to get any solo work done in the mornings before engaging with the classes in my afternoons.
          <br>This will be a little challenging on Sunday mornings, however I'll have fridays and saturdays to ensure I'm ready for sunday afternoon classes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Seeking Help:</h3>
        <p>I will largely use discord for seeking help.
          <br>My homegroup-six will be the first port of call as we have a few experienced programmers. I expect it will almost always be the last.
          <br>Knowing that my schedule is a little off from those of the rest of the class I'll work ahead where I can so I don't get stuck in the morning and have to wait until the afternoon before I can get past my block.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Expectations from Facilitators:</h3>
        <p>Clear communication via discord with any changes or expectations of me.
          <br>Timely responses to my discord questions when I'm stuck on something and the homegroup isn't responding or isn't sure on the solution.
          <br>Responses are only expected within the regular work hours for NZ.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Scheduling Information:</h3>
        <p>I have little to no other commitments during this course's period.
          <br>I am in a different timezone however. 6-7 hours ahead but behind a day.
          <br>This means I may fade slightly more than others towards the end of the workday but I am adjusting my sleep schedule and planning to take naps around my midday before classes start during bootcamp.
