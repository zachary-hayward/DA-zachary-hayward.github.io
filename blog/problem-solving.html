        <h3>Dealing With Being Blocked</h3>
        <p>
          Recently we did a little mock up of a cafe page where orders were taken and we had to write the code for purchases being made to track the cafe's cash and stock.
          I was doing great with figure the code out quite quickly until one function just broke everything and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why.
          <br>
          I was getting a bit annoyed with myself as it wasn't even a difficult part of the code, I should have been able to move on from this part a while ago.
          So eventually, I took a little break, got myself a drink and came back to it.
          <br>
          I saw the issue immediately, a simple typo. This kind of frustrated me more as when I had looked over my code but I'd looked at the "trickier" parts, not the easier parts.
          "function" was instead "funtion". What drew me to it wasn't the missing c initially but the fact that it was the wrong shade of blue.
          This shows me just how important it can be to pay attention to things like the patterns in code, the indentation, colouring, etc. 
          I don't know what other code editors are like but atleast with this one the colour the editor gives to words is very important as it signals what type of code that word or phrase is.
