        <h3>Dealing With Being Blocked</h3>
        <p>
          Recently we did a little mock up of a cafe page where orders were taken and we had to write the code for purchases being made to track the cafe's cash and stock.
          I was doing great with figure the code out quite quickly until one function just broke everything and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why.
          <br>
          I was getting a bit annoyed with myself as it wasn't even a difficult part of the code, I should have been able to move on from this part a while ago.
          So eventually, I took a little break, got myself a drink and came back to it.
          <br>
          I saw the issue immediately, a simple typo. This kind of frustrated me more as when I had looked over my code but I'd looked at the "trickier" parts, not the easier parts.
          "function" was instead "funtion". What drew me to it wasn't the missing c initially but the fact that it was the wrong shade of blue.
          This shows me just how important it can be to pay attention to things like the patterns in code, the indentation, colouring, etc. 
          I don't know what other code editors are like but atleast with this one the colour the editor gives to words is very important as it signals what type of code that word or phrase is.

        <h3>How I Solved a Problem Elegantly</h3>
        <p>
          So we did this exercise where we made a function that looked at a string of words and reacted to certain words in a specific way.
          It took me a little bit but I had recently learnt a symbol in JaveScript for the modulus which was fun because...I like math.
          <br>
          Anyway, the next exercise started quite similarly. It wanted to take a string of words and react to the same words as earlier but slightly differently.
          <br>
          I immediately started writing some very similar code to before, then thought this can't be right, I need to slow down, break down the problem, and talk myself through it, kinda like the 'rubber duck' method.
          As I went through the exercise page and re read things and explained them to myself I realised I could use my previous function to let me solve my current problem with one line.
          <br>
          This was a big reminder to slow down a little, read but also understand the directions. When I'm on a roll its too easy to start to speed through directions and just start writing code. 
          But like with any problem, breaking it down, readying it thoroughly and talking through what it actually wants until you understand can save you a lot of time in the long run.

        <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Psuedocode</h4>
        <p>
          This is something makes a lot of sense to me. In a conversation recently someone said something along the lines of the psuedocode is the main part of their coding. The "actual" code is just in the background to make the psuedocode happen.
          <br>
          I thought this was pretty interesting. When stuck on a problem if you can fully explain it in writing, that you can then read back to yourself your going to avoid a lot of pitfalls that might have gotten you otherwise.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <p>
          I like this approach to a point. Eventually I get frustrated when things arn't working though I often use this more for refactoring than intial code.
          I like to get something that I think I know, that I think will work down. And then work on making it more efficient/effective with other approaches.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber Ducky</h4>
        <p>
          This works well for me, I find that it helps me slow down my thinking and stall a second on each part of the code as I think about explaining it.
        </p>
        <h4>Error Messages</h4>
        <p>
          This is probably my least used problem solving technique so far, not because of a comfort thing but most of my issues have been in the kata's where I didn't have a webpage open with devtools.
          However, when trying out a few things on my page I have noticed that I'm quick to click on the link that takes me to the error line.
          The one hurdle I had which I hope won't have again is that during one of my problem solvings I hadn't saved the file and refreshed the page after attempting a fix. So the error was for the "current" file not the updated and unsaved one. 
          I imagine if I'll recognise that issue quickly in the future as the error didn't match the information on my line, easy to then recognise the files are different.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
          I do occasionally have trouble making console.log() messages show for me. I had to play around in some of the katas to figure out where and how I needed to place the line of code to ensure it fired and then understanding where the error message would be displayed.
          But ultimately I do like this approach, this one really helps me keep track of things so I'm not building good code ontop of an error and then focusing my debugging on the wrong section.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty comfortable with googling to solve problems. During my ba in math I was also distance studying but the support was next to nothing so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out some pretty complicated math on my own with google and youtube.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I havn't used this much yet, I expect when things get a little more challenging and 5-10 minutes on google/etc isn't enough to solve my issue then involving others will start to be a bit more beneficial.
          I do tend to enjoy figuring things out on my own but I have no issue coming to someone for help when I've tried my own solutions and have failed to get past something.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          Similar to asking peers, although I prefer to ask for help in a single succinct way that both peers and coaches can see and respond to rather than asking them seperately.
          I feel like this lets the more knowledgable coaches respond if they think it requires them or atleast I now know they are aware and respond if/when necessary.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a big reflector. I'm a big fan of things being efficient.
          <br>
          I love to not make the same mistakes over and over. Its frustrating and inefficient.
          Keeping tabs on whats tripped me up before and thinking through how and why it happened so I can avoid the same issues in the future is something that really drives me, 
          <br>
          e.g. was I just feeling really confident so I rushed something? Was I tired? Was I in a time crunch?
          <br>
          Do I need to have a timer on my watch that reminds me to go walk about and grab a glass of water. Hows my planning/pacing and execution of the plan going lately?
        </p>

        <h3>A time I was reluctant to ask for help.</h3>
        <p>
          I have noticed that if I believe I can do something, I'll try all the avenues I can to get it done before involving others.
          <br>
          If I look at a challenge, poke at it for a bit and come up empty I have no issue asking someone for their ideas.
          <br>
          Now I like to think I'm fairly realistic and reasonably humble. Sometimes I get it wrong.
          <br>
          If I'm calm, level headed and I think I've got something figured out I could spend all day working on a solution that only takes a minute or two to solve if you knew the right approach.
          <br>
          My biggest challenge is recognising these situations before I spend a day working on something just to find out there was a different theory/approach that needed to be applied that I just didn't consider.
          <br>
          I think an approach that could work for me is after I've spent what I think is a bit of an extended period on a problem, to just do a quick post to discord/group chats (I have one with some family that are programmers) saying 'hey, working on x y z, have tried a b c, thinking I'll do d e f next. Let me know if you think I'm barking up the wrong tree.' or something to that effect.
