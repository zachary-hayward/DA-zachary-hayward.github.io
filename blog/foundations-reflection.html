        <h3>Three New Things About Me & My Ego</h3>
        <p>
          I'm not really one for a big ego for the most part.
          <br>
          When I do feel like I'm -reeeaaally- good at something it can come into play 
          a little but honestly theres very few things I believe I'm- that- good at.
          Coding is definitely not one of them, yet.
          <br>
          The only time I feel like my ego showed at all was doing the first listen and loop
          exercise and I thought about how valuable of a life skill it was and how I've been 
          trying to approach conversations lately with a similar degree of mindfulness so good on me.

        <h3>Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in programming</h3>
        <p>
          Values are very important as you will more often than not be working in a team.
          Honesty, integrity, responsibility, following best practices, being professional and accountable
          are key to functioning as an effective team to get projects done on time and with as few hiccups as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is important all the way through the programming process.
          From initially trying to put yourself in the users shoes to work out what exactly the user needs, wants, how it will be experienced.
          Through the development process where you need to always consider the users experience, how user friendly is it, how friendly for visually-impaired is it, etc.
          Then also being open to user feedback to connect with them where you may have room to improve design.
          <br>
          Empaty is also key for the collaborative side of programming. You will very often be on a team.
          Respecting others opinions, being understanding when things happen that might interfere with another
          team members performance or ability to get something done by a deadline. If the team is functioning 
          well together, the whole process will be much more effective, efficient, and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness is helpful for understanding your strengths and weakness. This allows for good decisions
          around where to best be able to benefit a team and where to personally develop so you are able to tackle
          all aspects of the job effectively.
          <br>
          Being self-aware allows for more growth opportunities whether through being open to constructive 
          criticism or being able to seek out feedback and insight from more experienced programmers in areas 
          you may be weaker in. Knowning your strengths, weaknesses and personal interests helps with applying
          to different companies where your strengths can be utilised and perhaps your personal interests align 
          with what the company is doing.
          <br>
          Self-awareness is also key to managing your time effectively, knowning when you need a break, when you 
          might need to implement different parts of your learning plan or well-being plan to ensure a healthy and 
          productive state for you and your team.

        <h3>Most Surprising Thing About Core Skills</h3>
        <p>
          For me its definitely how much I've actually enjoyed thinking about it and trying to implement changes 
          in my life. Initially it kind of felt a bit "silly" or not overly useful but my attitude couldn't have 
          been more wrong.
          <br>
          I've found I'm using these concepts core skills covered all the time. When things don't quite feel right 
          I'm immediately considering:
          <ul>
            <li>My mindset, am I open to growth or stuck in a fixed mindset?</li>
            <li>How I'm doing, when was my last break, do I need fresh eyes?</li> 
            <li>Have I been keeping up with my well-being plan?</li>
          </ul>
          I'm also really enjoying mindful listening in all my conversations. While you generally can't sit there 
          and listen for 2 minutes straight without responding I have found it very satisfying and have enjoyed 
          conversations more when I'm actually paying attention and processing what the other person is saying. 
          My responses are better, they feel heard and are more engaged, all in all a great core skill for life.

        <h3>Most Challenge Aspects of Core Learning</h3>
        <p>
          I found it difficult sometimes to actually answer some of the prompts. Not for lack of trying but 
          they are often directed as a specific concept or idea that is either outside of something I normally 
          think about or perhaps not something that is one of my personal struggles. Trying to remember a time 
          I elegantly solved a problem took me days to come up with something.
          <br>
          Otherwise its been some of the implementation. Taking something from a concept and actually using it 
          in life has been a challenge but definitely rewarding. They are often so easily overlooked, like doing 
          the different things in my well-being plan. I will atleast half the time just go to sleep without thinking 
          about my day and practicing gratefulness for a few things.
        </p>

      <div class="blog-content-new-topic">
        <h3>Why focus on Core Skills?</h3>
        <p>
          Programming as an industry is so collaborative. You have to be able to healthily assess yourself and 
          function in a team environment to be successful, keep yourself in a healthy productive mental and physical state rather than 
          burning out or working on too little sleep/exercise/nutrition.
          <br>
          You can be incredible at the code side of things, but if you cant collaborate then its got 
          very limited usefulness to an employer. Most projects will not be solo, most of them will require 
          that you have some back and forward on ideas with a team to ensure the best product is developed. Understanding 
          yourself, how to work with others, how to get the best out of others, how to receive and give effective 
          feedback, etc. all come into play with function efficiently on a team.

        <h3>Has Core Skills Been Worth It?</h3>
        <p>
          Definitely. I can see benefits already from utilising the core skills in not only my foundations course work 
          but in other aspects of my life. I'm all-round happier, more enthusiastic, more energetic, more all-the-good-things 
          since applying some of the core skills. Considering my learning plan and well-being plan always leaves me in 
          a better place than before, my conversations with others are improving in quality and satisfaction, I'm finding 
          I can better manage my time in both foundation activities and other tasks. I feel like my interest has been high 
          in foundations so it hasn't been an issue but outside of foundations I've found my ability to engage with and 
          enjoy challenges has improved by trying to be mindful of maintaining a growth mindset in all things.
          <br>
          Honestly, looking back at this last few weeks I'd be sad to have learnt more code and less core.
