        <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>As of about a month ago I'm working out with my roommate mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Hes in great shape and I've noticed a decline in my physical health since I stopped doing manual labour.
          <br>We head down to a calisthenics park on the beach and a few different routines we go through. I'll often finish by running home which is about 4km.
          <br>On most tuesday evenings I go for a run with a running group, we usually do about a 5km loop and then ruin the effort by chatting or a beer or two.
          <br>Once a week on either tuesdays or thursdays I bike to a <a ref="https://www.pickleball.ky/">pickleball court (about 11km)</a> and then play for 1-2 hours before biking home.
          <br>I'm also part of a Gaelic Football club, we don't have many practices but every second weekend we have a match.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately I picked up a nasty cold in the US towards the end of last week so this week I have done diddly squat.</p>

        <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>A good friend of mine and I ended up marrying sisters and we all live together in a Caymans. 
           This means we each cook one night a week and share the meal together. 
           Couples fending for themselves the rest of the time.
           While schedules vary I always end up sitting down and eating with 2-3 people monday-thursday. 
           I think the timing will work out that our dinner will be during the lunchbreak in bootcamp too so thats going be great.
          <br>Keeping in touch with family back home in NZ is a real challenge as they are largely "free" while I'm asleep. 
           However a few brothers and I do play a little halo reach and chat on discord whenever we can get the times to lineup, usually the weekend.
          <br>I am going to commit to calling home on my saturdays to check in with mum and dad on their sundays.
          <br>My in-laws very much treat me as their son which is great. 
           We have continuous chats via messenger as they are currently taking care of our doggo and honestly, maybe love him more than we do so they are always keen to share what hes up to.
          <br>August through to about February was quite a new experience for me, setting up in a new country and having my wife incredibly busy with work then just wanting to unwind by reading/etc. in the evenings.
           I have been trying to find ways to connect and continue building our relationship in ways that fit this new dynamic.
           This includes clearing up frustrations quickly rather than letting them simmer and create distance. 
           And, I've been trying to practice mindful listening when shes sharing something, without -really- knowing what it was until this course.

        <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>My earlier mentioned physical activities will help with my mental wellbeing.
          <br>I find that whenever my emotional wellbeing is out of whack it's more often than not due to the current state of my relationship with my wife.
          As mentioned earlier I'm working on maintaining and building that relationship which benefits my emotional wellbeing a lot.
          <br>For new things, I'm going to commit to reflecting on my day before going to sleep and trying to think of 5 things I'm grateful for. 
          Or specifically people that I'm grateful for and why they stand out for me that day.
          And, if its appropriate I'll let them know.

        <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately most of our Gaelic games are on a sunday, however, when they arn't in the morning I attend church.
          <br>Reflecting on what I'm grateful for at the end of the day will also be tied into my Christian beliefs.
          <br>I'll commit to two one hour periods at the beach each where I can just sit/float/pray/meditate/appreciate creation.

        <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
        <p>I'll inadvertenly be spending time out on the beaches, running trails, etc. every week so I'll be sure to appreciate it when I do.</p>
