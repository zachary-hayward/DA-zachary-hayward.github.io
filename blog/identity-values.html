        <h3>Values and Ethics</h3>
        <p>I'm the 3rd child of 8. So early on we learned to consider other people, how our actions could impact others, e.g. if your a bit of weasel, it'l irk your older brothers and they'll kick your but.
          <br>Jokes aside we were taught to be fairly patient and considerate of others. I tend to be quite focused on one thing or another so can often fail to consider an outcome for someone else but its never out of a lack of empathy or compassion, just a lack of understanding the entire situation.
          <br>I was raised in a christian household. I find that even those that don't have a relationship with Jesus consider his teachings good practice. You often see some of the behavioural lessons Jesus taught being quoted by people as good life lessons.
          Turning the other cheek rather than eye-for-an-eye. Treating others as you would want to be treated. etc.
          <br>I tend to value these life lessons. Along with the general don't steal, don't hate, don't lie (I constantly debate with myself about if/where the line is for 'productive' white lies. Even if the truth is really quite inconvenient)
          <br>After the odd couple of years during/post covid where society appears to be more divided than ever I find myself struggling to show grace and forgiveness to situations where people seem to just hate for no apparent reason, on every side of every debate. But I am constantly reminding myself that Jesus forgives me for a whole assortment of things, I can atleast attempt to do the same.
        </p>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>I consider myself quite logical in my thought process. Analysis and base level of understanding of theories generally comes easily. Sometimes I can struggle applying the concepts in perculiar settings as I tend to not be as creative.
        <br>Ability to focus on a task for an extended period without losing efficiency.
        <br>I'm polite and fairly empathetic in my interactions with others.
        <br>I'm strong willed and persistent when it comes to challenges that I have an interest in overcoming.
