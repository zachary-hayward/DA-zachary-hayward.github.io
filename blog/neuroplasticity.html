        <h2>Neuroplasticity, Growth Mindset, and Me!</h2>
      </div>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to form new neural connections and strengthen current ones. This lets the brain adapt to damage and rewire/repair itself. Understanding neuroplasticity can help in the repair of brain tissue when people have an injury or stroke.
          <br>This also allows for improved learning and memory. Utilizing concepts like “use it or lose it”, “practice makes permanent”, and learning over a longer period people can enhance your learning and memory by practicing repeatedly to strengthen neural pathways and continueing to engage with the same or similar ideas over your lifetime. This keeps the pathways strong, the memories in tact, and the learning effective.
          <br>It also can help postpone age related issues with memory and declining cognitive abilities by keeping the brain as healthy and functional as possible.
          <br>Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity for me during this part of my life means to eat and sleep well, engage in active learning, space out my learning, and to continually focus on my goals while setting new challenging goals for myself.
          <br>This will allow me to:
          <ul>
            <li>Have a fuelled and ready brain each day.</li>
            <li>Intentionally engage with tasks and reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and how I could adjust.</li>
            <li>Continue to strengthen my neural pathways through practice, practice and practice.</li>
          </ul>
          Being well rested and fuelled with good nutrients allows for your brain to work much more efficiently. We all experience that decrease in focus and increase in brain fog that sometimes comes with working on something well past midnight or being worn down or sick, however, your brain actually started becoming less efficient much earlier on and these symptoms come quite late in the decline in your cognitive abilities.
          <br>Regular exercise is also a big part of keeping your body and brain functioning efficiently. Like mums always said, "eat well, sleep well, drink lots of fluids, get up and do something". Great advice.
          <br>This was an article that I thought was quite informative regarding your diet's impact on the brain which uses sources from reputed organisations: <a ref="https://www.rupahealth.com/post/neuroplasticity-and-nutrition-the-role-of-diet-in-brain-resilience-and-repair">RupaHealth - Neuroplasticity and Nutrition</a>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>A growth mindset is where you believe in being able to improve your abilities and intelligence.
          <br>This might sound normal but think of when you or someone you know came up against a challenge or task that you thought they could complete but they tried, “failed” and gave up on quickly.
          <br>This is a fixed mindset. They tried, didn’t complete it, and didn’t believe in their ability to improve and be able to overcome it.</p>
        <p>Developing a growth mindset is fundamental to improving your ability to overcome difficult challenges, persevere when things get difficult, and ultimately build on your abilities, intelligence, resilience and adaptability. All great things to develop over a lifetime.
          <br>I’ve been somewhat aware of the pitfalls of a fixed mindset this last 5-8 years or so. As a kid/teen I was well above average in academic abilities so I didn’t have to challenge myself a lot and often received a lot of praise for things I did well even though it was not difficult for me.
          <br>Finishing my bachelors in mathematics recently has made me all too aware and I have had to force myself to positively engage in challenging problems and encourage myself to put in the effort rather than just being happy to see final results.
          <br>This is part of myself that I am actively working on and I hope to see improve even more over this journey with DevAcademy.
