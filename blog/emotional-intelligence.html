          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is someones ability to recognize, understand, and manage both our own emotions and those of others as we are interacting with them.
          <br>It is important for social interactions, decision making and taking on challenges in a productive healthy way.
          <br>The main skills in emotional intelligence are:
          <ul>
            <li>The abilities to understand what makes yourself tick, how to get the best out of yourself by managing the types of situations you find challenging.</li>
            <li>The ability to understand others through empathy so you can interact with others in a positive manner that allows for constructive outcomes.</li>
            <li>The ability to clearly communicate with others to ensure interactions work towards a positive outcome.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>IQ focuses on reasoning, problem-solving, logical thinking and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
          <br>The main skills in IQ are things like memory, mathematical ability and analytical thinking.
          <br>A high IQ is generally associated with ability to learn information, process it, and apply it to solving problems.

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>Developing your EQ skills lets you interact with others in a more contructive and positive manner. As an employee, a supervisor/manager, it doesn't matter. It improves your ability to walk away from interactions with a positive outcome by having clear constructive communication that allows for everyone to understand eachother without conflict and misunderstandings.
          <br>EQ also helps when your not working with others by similarly understanding yourself to achieve better outcomes without getting as frustrated or blocked as you might otherwise.
